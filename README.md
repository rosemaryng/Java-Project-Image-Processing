# Java Project 2 -- Image Processing
### Introduction of the project
###### In this project, I created 6 functions for processing pictures, including "invert", "grayscale", "rotate", "flip", "blend", and "blur". I will give a simple explanation of what each function does. 
##### Invert
###### This function inverts the colour components of each pixel in the given picture. A colour component may be inverted by replacing the original intensity value of each primary colour, c, with the intensity (255- c) 
##### Grayscale
###### This function creates a monochrome version of the input picture. 
##### Rotate
###### This function rotates a picture by 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise about the picture’s centre.
##### Flip
###### The flip function is divded to 2 sub functions, ‘Flip horizontal’ and ‘flip vertical’. ‘Flip horizontal’ reflects the image about the y-axis, while ‘flip vertical’ mirrors the image about the x-axis.
##### Blend
###### The blend transformation takes a list of pictures and combines them together that they appear to be layered on top of each other in the new picture created. 
##### Blur
###### Blur creates a blurred version of the input picture by taking the average pixel-value of a pixel in its 3x3 neighbourhood.
